To Do:
~~~~~~

 * GenerateDeps() [input.go] should be refactored togethe with the js compiler
   to always generate a file and serve it as a first step to the unification.

 * List of files that will be compiled.
 * List of unit tests.
 * Validate settings before using them.
 * Avoid rescanning closure library folders continously.
 * Reuse deps.js instead of building a new one in /input/deps.js.

 * Build testing facilities to a folder in disk.
 * Better concurrency when disk seeks are common.
