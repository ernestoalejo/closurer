To Do:
~~~~~~
 
 * Move all the command line flags to the config package.
 * The gss compile handler should be transformed to new one, and the commented line
   of the main actived again.
 * When refactoring the JS package, move the compilation of CSS out of there to avoid
   dependencies.

~~~~~~

 * Separate packages for CSS, JS, SOY and server. Splitted from the config & main package.
 * The server should use mux if possible.
 * The server should use some facilities to run servers: templates, request and handler.
   Keep them up to date in a different lib.
 * Compile CSS and JS in different runs.

 * Stylesheets with images have the wrong URLs when using the /css handler.

 * Renaming a soy template after caching it, throws a multiple files providing X.
   The old JS file must be removed from the build directory.

 * GenerateDeps() [input.go] should be refactored together with the js compiler
   to always generate a file and serve it as a first step to the unification.

 * List of files that will be compiled.
 * Move the tests and benchmarks to a x_test.go file
 * Validate settings before using them.

 * Build testing facilities to a folder in disk.
