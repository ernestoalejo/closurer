To Do:
~~~~~~

 * Move the output filenames to each target.
 * Cache the config.
 * Implement inherits.
 * Add the multiarch loader.
 * The compiling errors should be show in the webpage if possible (not a build).

 * Memory allocation errors. Perhaps caching the deps tree (or it's struct
   in memory can help). Measure and fix it.
 ! Deal with the occasional cache reading errors (bad format) that appears sometimes.
 * Templates are recompiled everytime in production mode.

 * Errors in the compilation should be reported to the page, not only the console.

 * List of files that will be compiled.
 * Build testing facilities to a folder in disk.
