To Do:
~~~~~~

 * Add the option to output a mapping file between the targets and the outputs.

 * The compiling errors should be show in the webpage if possible (not a build).
 * Templates are recompiled everytime in production mode.

 * Memory allocation errors. Perhaps caching the deps tree (or it's struct
   in memory can help). Measure and fix it.
 * Deal with the occasional cache reading errors (bad format) that appears sometimes.
 * Errors in the compilation should be reported to the page, not only the console.
 * List of files that will be compiled.
 * Build testing facilities to a folder in disk.
