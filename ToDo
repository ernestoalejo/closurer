To Do:
~~~~~~

 * Memory allocation errors. Perhaps caching the deps tree (or its struct
   in memory can help). Measure and fix it.
 * Don't call the CSS compiler every single build.

 *  Add the vendor option to the Gss compiler.

 * config.Current() it's silly; use global or something like that.
 * The compiling errors should be show in the webpage if possible (not a build).

 * Deal with the occasional cache reading errors (bad format) that appears sometimes.
 * Errors in the compilation should be reported to the page, not only the console.
 * List of files that will be compiled.
 * Build testing facilities to a folder in disk.
