To Do:
~~~~~~

 * An error in the GSS compiler shouldn't close the app.
 * Cache the config.
 * Implement inherit.

 * Adapt to a multi-arch compilation (+ loader).
 * Memory allocation errors. Perhaps caching the deps tree (or it's struct
   in memory can help). Measure and fix it.
 ! Deal with the occasional cache reading errors (bad format) that appears sometimes.
 * Templates are recompiled everytime in production mode.

 * Errors in the compilation should be reported to the page, not only the console.

 * List of files that will be compiled.
 * Build testing facilities to a folder in disk.
