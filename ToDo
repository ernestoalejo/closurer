To Do:
~~~~~~

 * Move the DepsTree building to the scan package.
 * When refactoring the JS package, move the compilation of CSS & SOY out of there.
 * Move home to the main package, its too short to have its own file.
 * Validate the config object before using it.

~~~~~~

 * Separate packages for CSS, JS, SOY and server. Splitted from the config & main package.
 * Compile CSS and JS in different runs.

 * Stylesheets with images have the wrong URLs when using the /css handler.

 * Renaming a soy template after caching it, throws a multiple files providing X.
   The old JS file must be removed from the build directory.

 * GenerateDeps() [input.go] should be refactored together with the js compiler
   to always generate a file and serve it as a first step to the unification.

 * List of files that will be compiled.
 * Move the tests and benchmarks to a x_test.go file

 * Build testing facilities to a folder in disk.
