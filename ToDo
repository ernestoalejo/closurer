To Do:
~~~~~~

 * Don't cache between input and compile modes.

 * Move the contents of templates.go and request.go to handler.go.
 * GenerateDeps() [input.go] should be refactored together with the js compiler
   to always generate a file and serve it as a first step to the unification.

 * List of files that will be compiled.
 * Move the tests and benchmarks to a x_test.go file
 * Validate settings before using them.

 * Build testing facilities to a folder in disk.
