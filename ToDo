To Do:
~~~~~~

 * Don't recompile templates if they haven't changed: use inotify when opened, and dates
   diff when loading the cache.
 * Don't recompile the code if the folders haven't changed: use inotify, recompile the first
   time.
 * Send the checks and define contents to the compiler.
 * Read production settings (inherits).
 * Option to build the app.
 * Closure stylesheets.
